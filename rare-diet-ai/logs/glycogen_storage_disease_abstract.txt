BACKGROUND: Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) is one of the most common 
hepatic GSD. Its treatment mainly consists of a diet including a high intake of 
slow-digestion carbohydrates such as raw cornstarch and the restriction of 
simple sugars. This enables the maintenance of euglycemia and prevents secondary 
metabolic disorders. Starch is a glucose polymer formed by amylose and 
amylopectin, which can be obtained from distinct sources. Although uncooked 
cornstarch has been successfully used in the treatment of GSD-Ia, it can lead to 
hyperglycemia and weight gain. in vitro andin vivo tests indicated that sweet 
manioc starch can be potentially used in the treatment of GSD-Ia.
RESULTS: The moisture analysis revealed a variation from 10.3 to 12.8% in the 
sweet manioc starch samples, whereas the moisture content of uncooked cornstarch 
ranged from 7.3 to 11.1%. Quantifiable sugar was detected in 3/5 samples of 
sweet manioc starch and 1/3 samples of uncooked cornstarch. Notably, this 
uncooked cornstarch brand is widely employed in GSD-Ia treatment in Brazil. 
Products B and E had higher values of amylopectin and undetectable levels of 
sugars. A clinical trial is warranted to compare samples F and G and determine 
the impact of sugar trace in the same dietary source of starch.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results demonstrated possible therapeutic 
alternatives for GSD-Ia in addition to traditional uncooked cornstarch.

Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are a group of carbohydrate metabolism 
disorders, most of which are inherited in autosomal recessive patterns. GSDs are 
of two types: those that have to do with liver and hypoglycaemia (hepatic GSDs) 
and those that are linked to neuromuscular presentation. This study aims to 
assess the impact of dietary intervention, including medium-chain triglyceride 
(MCT) oil, on anthropometric measurements, body composition analysis and 
metabolic parameters among Jordanian children and is expected to be the first in 
the country. A sample of 38 children with glycogen storage disease type 1 
(GSD-1) (median age = 6.4 years) were on a diet that included uncooked 
cornstarch therapy and a fructose-, sucrose- and lactose-restricted diet. 
Patients started to take MCT oil along with the prescribed diet after the first 
body composition test. Patients' nutritional status was re-evaluated three 
months later. The study results show that the percentage of patients who 
suffered from hypoglycaemia at the beginning of the study decreased 
significantly from 94.7% to 7.9% (p < 0.0001). The serum levels of 
triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid and lactate decreased significantly after 
three months of intervention (100-71.1%, 73.7-21.1%, 97.4-52.6% and 94.7-18.4%, 
respectively). In contrast, there was no statistical difference in neutrophil 
count. Regarding clinical parameters, liver span was significantly reduced from 
(16.01 ± 2.65 cm) to (14.85 ± 2.26 cm) (p < 0.0001). There were significant 
improvements in growth parameters, including height-for-age and BMI-for-age for 
children aged ≥2 years (p = 0.034 and p = 0.074, respectively). Significant 
improvements in skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral content were also noticed 
at the end of the trial (p ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, medium-chain triglyceride 
therapy is found to improve biochemical and growth parameters in children with 
GSD-1 in Jordan.

AIM: Dietary therapy of glycogen storage disease I (GSD I) is based on frequent 
feeding, with a high intake of complex carbohydrates (supplied by uncooked 
cornstarch), restriction of sugars, and a lower amount of lipids. There is 
limited information about the dietary regimen in patients with GSD, which might 
affect the intestinal luminal pH and microbiota composition. The aim of this 
study to investigate the intestinal microbiota composition in patients with GSD 
receiving diet treatment.
METHOD: Twelve patients who were followed up with GSD I after the diagnosis 
receiving diet therapy and 11 healthy children have been enrolled. Intestinal 
microbiota composition was evaluated by 16 s rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: A significant difference was found for beta-diversity between the GSD 
group and controls. A significantly lower abundance of Firmicutes and higher 
abundance of Actinobacteria was found in GSD group compared to the controls. 
Akkermansia, Pseudoalteromonas, Uruburella, and Castellaniella were dominant in 
the GSD patients at the genus level, while Faecalibacterium, Bacterioides, 
Gemmiger, Parabacteroides in the control group. At species level, 
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii decreased, and Akkermansia muciniphila were 
dominant in children with GSD.
DISCUSSION: There is a substantial change in the composition of the gut 
microbiota, reduction of F. prausnitzii and an increase of A. muciniphila in 
children with GSD receiving consumption of uncooked cornstarch. Alterations of 
the intestinal microbiota might be related with the disease itself or dietary 
restrictions in patients with GSD, however, in certain condition, dysbiosis can 
negatively affect the course and make it difficult to control the disease.
