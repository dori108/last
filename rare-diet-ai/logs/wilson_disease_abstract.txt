BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic peripheral hyperinsulinemia, resulting from peripheral 
insulin administration in type 1 diabetes, may increase insulin resistance and 
impair endothelial function. We hypothesized that lowering iatrogenic peripheral 
hyperinsulinemia via a one-week, reduced-carbohydrate diet (RCD) would improve 
insulin sensitivity and endothelial function compared with an isocaloric 
standard carbohydrate diet (SCD).
METHODS: In this randomized, single-blinded, crossover trial, we studied 12 
adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants completed both a one-week RCD and a 
one-week SCD, separated by a three-week washout. After each intervention, we 
measured insulin sensitivity using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and 
assessed endothelial function via brachial-artery flow-mediated vasodilation 
(FMD).
RESULTS: The RCD reduced total daily insulin doses by 16% compared with the SCD. 
Despite this reduction, insulin sensitivity did not improve (median glucose 
infusion rates: RCD 8.1 mg/kg FFM/min [IQR 6.7-10.1] vs. SCD 8.6 mg/kg FFM/min 
[7.0-11.0], p = 0.47). Similarly, endothelial function did not differ 
significantly (FMD after RCD 7.50% [3.25-15.5] vs. SCD 9.81% [4.96-14.3], 
p = 0.91). Although higher insulin doses correlated with lower insulin 
sensitivity under both conditions, lowering insulin dose through the RCD alone 
did not yield measurable improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a one-week RCD significantly lowered insulin requirements, 
it failed to enhance insulin sensitivity or endothelial function in adults with 
type 1 diabetes. These findings underscore the complex and dynamic relationship 
between insulin exposure and cardiometabolic health. Similar basal overnight 
insulin delivery may have masked potential benefits by the time of testing, 
highlighting the need for further studies to refine strategies aimed at 
mitigating hyperinsulinemia's adverse effects.

Fetal growth restriction (FGR) caused by placental insufficiency is a major 
contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is currently no in utero 
treatment for placental insufficiency or FGR. The placenta serves as the vital 
communication, supply, exchange, and defense organ for the developing fetus and 
offers an excellent opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Here we show 
efficacy of repeated treatments of trophoblast-specific human insulin-like 1 
growth factor (IGF1) gene therapy delivered in a non-viral, polymer nanoparticle 
to the placenta for the treatment of FGR. Using a guinea pig maternal nutrient 
restriction model (70% food intake) of FGR, nanoparticle-mediated IGF1 treatment 
was delivered to the placenta via ultrasound guidance across the second half of 
pregnancy, after establishment of FGR. This treatment resulted in correction of 
fetal weight in MNR + IGF1 animals compared to sham treated controls on an ad 
libitum diet, increased fetal blood glucose and decreased fetal blood cortisol 
levels compared to sham treated MNR, and showed no negative maternal 
side-effects. Overall, we show a therapy capable of positively impacting the 
entire pregnancy environment: maternal, placental, and fetal. This combined with 
our previous studies using this therapy at mid pregnancy in the guinea pig and 
in two different mouse model and three different human in vitro/ex vivo models, 
demonstrate the plausibility of this therapy for future human translation. Our 
overall goal is to improve health outcomes of neonates and decrease numerous 
morbidities associated with the developmental origins of disease.

CONTEXT: Postprandial lipemia (PPL) is associated with increased risk of 
endothelial dysfunction (ED), a precursor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD). The effects of low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diets on ASCVD 
risk are uncertain; therefore, gaining a greater understanding of LCHF meals on 
PPL may provide valuable insights.
OBJECTIVE: The current systematic review investigated the effects of single LCHF 
meal consumption on PPL and markers of ED.
DATA SOURCES: CINAHL Plus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for key terms related to 
endothelial function, cardiovascular disease, glycemia, lipemia, and the 
postprandial state with no restriction on date.
DATA EXTRACTION: Full-text articles were independently screened by 2 reviewers, 
of which 16 studies were eligible to be included in the current review. All 
trials reported a minimum analysis of postprandial triglycerides (PPTG) 
following consumption of an LCHF meal (<26% of energy as carbohydrate). Results 
were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.
DATA ANALYSIS: Single-meal macronutrient composition was found to play a key 
role in determining postprandial lipid and lipoprotein responses up to 8 hours 
post-meal. Consumption of LCHF meals increased PPTG and may contribute to ED via 
reduced flow-mediated dilation and increased oxidative stress; however, energy 
and macronutrient composition varied considerably between studies.
CONCLUSION: Consumption of an LCHF meal had a negative impact on PPL based on 
some, but not all, single-meal studies; therefore, the contribution of LCHF 
meals to cardiometabolic health outcomes remains unclear. Further research is 
needed on specific categories of LCHF diets to establish a causal relationship 
between postprandial modulation of lipids/lipoproteins and impaired vascular 
endothelial function.
