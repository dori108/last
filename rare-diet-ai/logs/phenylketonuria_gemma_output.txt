INTRODUCTION: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of 
phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism resulting from deficiency of phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH). Untreated, PKU may result in severe and irreversible 
intellectual impairment due to marked hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Guidelines 
recommend lifelong reduction in Phe levels, usually achieved via a strict 
low-protein diet and sometimes medications.
AREAS COVERED: We discuss the role of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential 
PAH cofactor in Phe metabolism, describe the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, 
and metabolism of sepiapterin, as well as reporting on its efficacy and safety 
in children and adults with PKU.
EXPERT OPINION: Sepiapterin, an oral synthetic form of a natural precursor of 
BH4, can reduce HPA in some patients with PKU. In relatively short-term studies, 
sepiapterin has been shown to be safe, well tolerated, and like the BH4 analog 
sapropterin dihydrochloride effective in reducing blood Phe levels in responsive 
individuals. The reductions in blood Phe observed with sepiapterin in the phase 
III APHENITY trial has the potential to allow more PKU patients to attain Phe 
treatment targets or alternatively easing of the onerous dietary Phe 
restrictions. Results of longer-term studies in patients with PKU, including 
neurocognitive and functional outcomes, nutritional status, and quality of life 
are awaited.

This narrative review explores a novel challenge to adherence in patients with 
phenylketonuria (PKU). Traditional barriers to maintaining the core of PKU 
therapy, which involves dietary restrictions, include limited palatability, high 
costs, difficult access to low-phenylalanine foods, time constraints, and social 
interference. We propose that adherence may also be hindered by elevated 
phenylalanine levels in nonadherent patients, leading to cognitive and executive 
function impairment that reduces their ability to adhere to the diet. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that the pathophysiological features of PKU create 
a vicious cycle that exacerbates adherence challenges to the 
phenylalanine-restricted diet. We therefore propose that PKU may be considered 
"an adherence disease". The implications of this hypothesis are threefold: 1. 
Long-term dietary nonadherence is probable among individuals with PKU; 2. the 
disease itself contributes to the difficulty in adhering to dietary 
restrictions, potentially alleviating patient guilt; 3. while treatment options 
depend on individual factors such as disease severity, the most effective 
approach to mitigating the neurocognitive and psychosocial impacts of PKU is to 
replace or restore phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.

Plain Language Summary: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common genetic 
metabolic disorder. Its management requires adhering to a challenging diet that 
eliminates phenylalanine to prevent its accumulation in the brain, which can 
cause significant neurological deficits affecting the patient’s quality of 
life.This review focuses on long-term adherence to this diet, as part of a 
broader investigation into the mechanisms of nonadherence which represents a 
critical issue in medicine.In this article, we propose to consider PKU as an 
adherence disease—a unique case where the disease’s pathophysiology negatively 
impacts adherence through a vicious cycle, detailed in this review.This 
narrative review is the first to apply general adherence concepts from other 
diseases to PKU in an interdisciplinary manner.Finally, the concept of 
“adherence disease”—analogous to terms like heart disease— suggests that 
adherence is a beneficial function prone to failure that can be corrected by 
understanding its mechanisms.This investigation provides strong support for 
research in gene therapy for PKU.

Newborn screening for Phenylketonuria enables early detection and timely 
treatment with a phenylalanine-restricted diet to prevent severe neurological 
impairment. Although effective and in use for 60 years, screening, diagnostic, 
and treatment practices still vary widely across countries and centers. To 
evaluate the Phenylketonuria newborn screening practices internationally, we 
designed a survey with questions focusing on the laboratory aspect of the 
screening system. We analyzed 24 completed surveys from 23 countries. Most 
participants used the same sampling age range of 48-72 h; they used tandem mass 
spectrometry and commercial non-derivatized kits to measure phenylalanine (Phe), 
and had non-negative cut-off values (COV) set mostly at 120 µmol/L of Phe. 
Participants mostly used genetic analysis of blood and detailed amino acid 
analysis from blood plasma as their confirmatory methods and set the COV for the 
initiation of dietary therapy at 360 µmol/L of Phe. There were striking 
differences in practice as well. While most participants reported a 48-72 h 
range for age at sampling, that range was overall quite diverse Screening COV 
varied as well. Additional screening parameters, e.g., the 
phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio were used by some participants to determine the 
screening result. Some participants included testing for tetrahydrobiopterin 
deficiency, or galactosemia in their diagnostic process. Results together showed 
that there is room to select a best practice from the many practices applied. 
Such a best practice of PKU-NBS parameters and post-screening parameters could 
then serve as a generally applicable guideline.
